## Welcome to my Docker repository

Here you'll find some Docker compose files to use in your local  environment by setting a Docker Swarm cluster. Which I prefer in order to have a near cluster concept such as managers and nodes.

The main goal is to show the best practices and try create a stable and realiable environment that we can use for DevSecOps purposal.

## Pre-requistes

1. [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
2. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/) cli

* Once you have met all the above requisites move forward to documentation section
